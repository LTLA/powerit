# Power iterations in C++

Not much to say here, this repository just contains a header-only C++ library to perform power iterations.
It's a quick-and-dirty method of getting the first eigenvector from a diagonalizable matrix - most typically from a covariance matrix, to get the first principal component.
Well, maybe it's not so quick, but it doesn't add any dependencies and it'll get the job done.
And sometimes that's enough.
